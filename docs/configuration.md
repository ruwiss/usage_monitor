# Configuration

All settings work out of the box - no configuration file is needed. To customize behavior, create a file called `usage-monitor-settings.json` with only the keys you want to change:

```json
{
  "poll_interval": 180,
  "bar_fg": "#00cc66",
  "bar_fg_warn": "#ff6600"
}
```

The app searches for this file in these locations (first match wins):

1. **`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/usage-monitor-settings.json`** (only if a custom config directory is set via `--config-dir` or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) - so each instance can have its own settings
2. **Next to the EXE** (or project root when running from source). On macOS this is `Contents/MacOS/` inside the `.app` (usually not writable) **or** the folder that contains `Usage Monitor.app`
3. **`~/.claude/usage-monitor-settings.json`** (legacy Claude Code config dir; still used as the last fallback). On macOS, new settings from the popup are written here when the app bundle is not writable.

Settings are read at startup. Source selection and custom sources written from the Settings panel are persisted here. After a manual edit, use **Restart** in the tray menu.

## Custom HTTP sources

Add these from the popup **Settings** panel (**Custom source** card). Enter a name, URL, optional header/token, then **Test URL**. Suggested quota fields are pre-checked. Rename the **Display name** before adding. If the guess is wrong, open **All JSON values** or type a path such as `quotas.session.used`. Hide or remove a source from the **Sources** card. Unchecked sources stay saved but disappear from the tray Source menu. Native sources can only be unchecked, not deleted.

Accepted shapes (nested is fine):

```json
{
  "quotas": {
    "session": { "utilization": 48, "resets_at": "2026-09-05T18:00:00Z" },
    "weekly": { "used": 12, "total": 100, "resetAt": "2026-09-12T00:00:00Z" }
  }
}
```

Also recognized: `remaining` + `limit` / `total`, `remainingPercentage`, and number fields whose names look like usage (`percent`, `credits`, …).

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `custom_sources` | Array of `{ id, name, url, header, token, fields }` |
| `hidden_sources` | Array of source ids hidden from the tray Source menu, e.g. `["claude", "custom:mine"]` |
| `fields` | Chosen paths: `{ path, key, label }`. Empty `fields` scans `quotas` or the whole object (legacy) |



## Alert thresholds

Configure usage percentage thresholds that trigger desktop notifications. Session and weekly quotas have separate thresholds since their time horizons differ significantly. Set to an empty array `[]` to disable alerts for a specific quota type.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `alert_thresholds_five_hour` | `[50, 80, 95]` | Thresholds (%) for Session (5hr) |
| `alert_thresholds_seven_day` | `[95]` | Thresholds (%) for Weekly quotas (7 day and all variants) |
| `alert_thresholds_extra_usage` | `[50, 80, 95]` | Thresholds (%) for Extra Usage (paid overage) |
| `alert_extra_usage_spent` | `[]` | Absolute Extra Usage spending amounts (in your billing currency, e.g. `[50, 100, 150]` for dollars) that trigger a notification - the only alert that works when extra usage has no monthly limit |
| `alert_time_aware` | `true` | Only alert when usage outpaces elapsed time |
| `alert_time_aware_below` | `90` | Time-aware check applies only to thresholds below this value; thresholds at or above always fire |

Threshold lookup uses a fallback chain: exact match (e.g. `alert_thresholds_seven_day_opus`), then base period (e.g. `alert_thresholds_seven_day`), then no alerts. This lets you configure stricter thresholds per variant when needed:

```json
{
    "alert_thresholds_seven_day_opus": [50, 80, 95]
}
```

## App updates

On launch the packaged app checks `https://github.com/ruwiss/usage_monitor/releases/latest/download/latest.json` (a static release file, not the GitHub REST API) at most once every 6 hours. If a newer signed build exists, one desktop notification is shown and the update installs silently. No further notifications are sent. Debug/`tauri dev` builds skip the check.

Linux auto-update applies to AppImage installs. `.deb` / `.rpm` installs still need a manual package update.

macOS CI builds are ad-hoc signed (no Developer ID). After an auto-update the app strips `com.apple.quarantine` from the `.app` (the same as `xattr -cr "/Applications/Usage Monitor.app"`, without `sudo`) so Gatekeeper does not report a damaged app on restart. First install from a `.dmg` can still need that command once if macOS blocked the first launch.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `auto_update` | `true` | Check for and apply app updates on startup |

## Update notification

When a background token refresh installs a new Claude CLI version, the app shows a desktop notification reporting the version change. Set this to `false` to suppress that notification.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `notify_claude_update` | `true` | Show a notification when a background token refresh installs a new Claude CLI version |

## Tooltip fields

The tray tooltip shows a quick usage summary when you hover over the icon. By default, it displays the session (5h) and weekly (7d) quotas. Use `tooltip_fields` to choose which usage fields appear in the tooltip.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `tooltip_fields` | `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Which usage fields to show in the tray tooltip, in order |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. Duplicates are silently removed. An empty array `[]` is valid (tooltip shows only the title, no usage fields). Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, it is simply skipped.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

**Example** - show session and Sonnet quota in the tooltip:

```json
{
    "tooltip_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet"]
}
```

## Limit display

Quota bars, the tray number, and the tooltip show **used** percent by default. Switch to remaining from the popup **Settings** panel or this key.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `show_remaining` | `false` | `true` shows remaining quota on bars and the tray icon; `false` shows used |


## Popup fields

The popup shows usage bars for all active quota types by default. Use `popup_fields` to control which bars appear and in what order.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `popup_fields` | `["*"]` | Which usage fields to show in the popup, in order. `"*"` is a wildcard meaning "all remaining non-null fields in default order" |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. `"*"` may appear at most once. Duplicates are silently removed. Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, it is simply skipped.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

**Default order** (used for `"*"` and when no setting is present): shorter periods first (`hour` before `day`), base field before variants, variants alphabetically.

**Examples:**

| Setting | Result |
|---------|--------|
| *(not set)* | All non-null fields in default order |
| `["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet", "*"]` | Session first, then Sonnet, then all remaining |
| `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Only these two, everything else hidden |
| `["*"]` | Same as not set |

```json
{
    "popup_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet", "*"]
}
```

## Compact pinned view

The detail popup can be pinned open (pin button in the header) so it stays visible and can be dragged anywhere. Use `compact_hide` to strip the pinned popup down to just the usage bars you care about - the entries listed here are hidden **only while the popup is pinned**, and reappear when you unpin it.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `compact_hide` | `[]` | Sections and usage bars to hide while the popup is pinned |

Must be an array of non-empty strings. Duplicates are silently removed. Unknown names are accepted and simply have no effect. With the default empty list, pinning changes nothing about what is shown.

Entries can be either a **section key** or a **usage field name**:

**Section keys:** `account` (email and plan), `extra_usage` (paid overage bar), `status` (the footer with the update time). The usage bar section itself cannot be hidden as a whole - hide individual bars by their field name instead. When nothing but the usage bars is left, the "Usage" heading is dropped automatically.

**Usage field names:** any quota field, e.g. `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`. This hides that single bar in the pinned view, independent of [`popup_fields`](#popup-fields) (which controls the normal, unpinned popup).

**Example** - pin to a minimal view with only the session and weekly bars:

```json
{
    "compact_hide": ["account", "extra_usage", "status", "seven_day_sonnet", "seven_day_opus"]
}
```

## Tray icon bars

The tray icon displays two small progress bars. By default, these show the session (5h) and weekly (7d) quotas. Use `icon_fields` to choose which two API fields are displayed, and `icon_style` to switch the icon layout.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `icon_fields` | `["five_hour", "seven_day"]` | Which two usage fields to show as icon bars. The first entry is the top bar (also determines the icon text), the second is the bottom bar |
| `icon_style` | `"number+bars"` | Icon layout: `"number+bars"` shows the first field's percentage above two progress bars; `"numbers"` shows both fields as two stacked percentages without bars |

Must be an array of exactly 2 non-empty strings. Unknown field names are accepted - if a field is `null` or missing from the API response, the bar shows 0%.

**Known field names:** `five_hour`, `seven_day`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_cowork`, `seven_day_oauth_apps`

Each entry can optionally include a display mode suffix using colon syntax: `"field_name:mode"`.

**Available bar display modes:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `utilization` | *(default)* Fills left-to-right proportional to current usage |
| `overage` | Shows how far usage has entered the over-budget zone: empty when usage is at or below the time marker (on pace or ahead), half-filled when usage is halfway between the time marker and 100%, full when usage reaches 100% |

In `utilization` mode, each bar also shows a thin vertical marker at the elapsed-time position of the quota period - the same information as the time marker in the detail popup. When usage is ahead of the elapsed time (or fully exhausted), the bar fill switches to the warning color (`fg_warn` in [Tray icon colors](#tray-icon-colors)), matching the popup's red warning fill.

**The `"numbers"` style** replaces the bars with a second percentage: the first `icon_fields` entry becomes the top row, the second the bottom row. Each row follows the same rules as the classic icon text - an exhausted quota shows `✕` (or `$` when paid extra usage is still available), and when both are exhausted the icon collapses to a single full-size `✕`/`$`. The time marker, the warning color, and the `:overage` suffix have no effect in this style.

**Example** - show session and weekly usage as two stacked percentages:

```json
{
    "icon_style": "numbers"
}
```

**Example** - show session in overage mode and weekly in default mode:

```json
{
    "icon_fields": ["five_hour:overage", "seven_day"]
}
```

**Example** - show session and Sonnet quota (default utilization mode):

```json
{
    "icon_fields": ["five_hour", "seven_day_sonnet"]
}
```

## Event commands

Run a shell command when a usage event occurs. See [Event Commands](event-commands.md) for examples and available environment variables.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `on_reset_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when a quota resets (usage drops) |
| `on_startup_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run once after the first successful API update following app start |
| `on_threshold_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when usage crosses a configured alert threshold |
| `quick_action_command` | *(none)* | Shell command (or array of commands) to run when you trigger the quick action. Triggered by a double-click on the tray icon, or by the **Run Quick Action** menu entry where the desktop keeps the click. Formerly `on_double_click_command`, which still works |

## Polling intervals

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `poll_interval` | `180` | Seconds between API updates |
| `poll_fast` | `120` | Seconds when usage is actively increasing |
| `poll_fast_extra` | `2` | Extra fast polls after usage stops increasing |
| `poll_error` | `30` | Seconds after a transient error (5xx, network). Rate-limit errors (429) use exponential backoff instead |
| `max_backoff` | `900` | Maximum backoff in seconds for rate-limit errors (15 min) |
| `idle_pause` | `300` | Seconds of inactivity before polling pauses (0 = disable). Polling also pauses when the workstation is locked |

## Language

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `language` | *(auto-detected)* | Override the UI language with a language code. Available: `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `hi`, `id`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt-BR`, `uk`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW` |

## Time Format

By default, reset times follow your system's clock format (the 24-hour or 12-hour / AM-PM setting from your regional preferences), so no configuration is needed. Set this key to override the auto-detected format.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `time_format` | *(auto-detected from your system)* | Clock format for reset times: `"24h"` (e.g. `14:30`) or `"12h"` (e.g. `2:30 PM`) |

## Currency

The app shows extra usage amounts in the billing currency the Anthropic API reports for your account (its symbol and decimal precision), falling back to your system locale's currency symbol when the API does not report one. An override set here always wins. Number formatting (decimal separator, symbol position) always follows your system locale.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `currency_symbol` | *(from API, else locale)* | Override the displayed currency symbol (e.g., `"$"`, `"€"`, `"¥"`) |

## Tray icon colors

Override individual channels as RGBA arrays `[R, G, B, A]` (0-255). Unspecified keys keep their defaults.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `icon_light` | `{"fg": [255,255,255,255], "fg_half": [255,255,255,80], "fg_dim": [255,255,255,140], "fg_warn": [224,80,80,255]}` | Light icons for dark taskbar |
| `icon_dark` | `{"fg": [0,0,0,255], "fg_half": [0,0,0,80], "fg_dim": [0,0,0,140], "fg_warn": [224,80,80,255]}` | Dark icons for light taskbar |

## Popup colors

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `bg` | `"#1e1e1e"` | Background |
| `fg` | `"#cccccc"` | Text |
| `fg_dim` | `"#888888"` | Dimmed text (labels, reset times) |
| `fg_heading` | `"#ffffff"` | Section headings |
| `fg_link` | `"#4a9eff"` | Link text |
| `bar_bg` | `"#333333"` | Progress bar background |
| `bar_fg` | `"#4a9eff"` | Progress bar fill |
| `bar_fg_warn` | `"#e05050"` | Progress bar fill when usage outpaces elapsed time, error text |
| `bar_divider` | `"#000c"` | Time dividers on progress bars (hour marks on the session bar, midnights on weekly bars) |
| `bar_marker` | `"#fffc"` | Time-position marker on progress bars |
